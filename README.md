## Major Info (TLDR)

### Goals:
The goals for this POC were basically just to mess around with canvas and paint, and as far as that goes, I very much acomplished my goal.

### Problems Encountered

#### Problem 1: Dr. Hoot was right and doing anything with canvas is a pain
##### Status: This will probably never be solved.
Drawing with canvas is relativly simple on the surface, it isnt conceptually complex or anything, it just kinda sucks. I think this stems from the fact that drawing uses views (ie. ENTIRE VIEWS), and not just a layout item in XML, which would be far simpler in my opinion. Along the same vein, a Canvas object requires a context, and contexts are easy until you start working with things like fragments, which I tried and failed to accomplish

### App Completion Status
This app is completed. It could have more features, but honestly I lost my drive to add anything more interesting. From what I have seen from my limited perspective and experience, Canvas and Paint are novelty classes, and hold little value for what I one day hope to accomplish with my programming.
